feel free to read [install.sh](https://github.com/jonathan-annett/zedd/blob/115e3e6f3cb0021fe80331dce466c08b764f5cf3/install.sh#L1)
and enter commands manually, as this assumes your system has nothing installed.

```bash
cd ~

git clone https://github.com/jonathan-annett/zedd.git
cd zedd
chmod 755 install.sh
# use your actual domain name and email address, don't put a leading www.
sudo ./install.sh example.com me@gmail.com
